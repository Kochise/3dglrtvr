	This file is a listing of all the code that is useless
	It could be either old code that should be removed/changed
	Or recent code, or a may-be feature. It is supposed to
	Be classified in some sort of way :)

	FUTURE 
		- InstanciateFromStream and SyntaxException will be used with the script parser
		- everything that has to do with refraction index (should be renamed)
		- everything concerning Lights other than diffuselight
		- Row3d may be used. One day. I just wanted a full algebra.

	OLD
		- ?
