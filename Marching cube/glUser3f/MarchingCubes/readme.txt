Hi,

I was a bit bored yesterday (10-31-2003) so I thought of programming something cool and contribute to NeHe's site [nehe.gamedev.net] where I first learned OpenGL, it took me around 5 hours to figure out the theory and come up with this, a Marching Cubes Algorithm demo!
This demo shows 3 cubes floating around in 3D space, when 2 (or more cubes) get close enough to each other, they flow together, creating a cool effect.
The Grid class I programmed to create this demo is pretty reusable, you can use it to render any isosurface, as long as you know it's equation.
If you have questions, just post at NeHe's forums, I (or any other member of this wonderful community) will be there and try to help.
Happy gridding ;)
