<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>These grids have the following property: take any four points in a rectangle formation {<I>A</I>, <I>B</I>, <I>C</I>, <I>D</I>} and they will satisfy the equation <I>A</I><SUP>2</SUP>+<I>D</I><SUP>2</SUP> = <I>B</I><SUP>2</SUP>+<I>C</I><SUP>2</SUP>. So for example, in the first grid below, the points {63, 1224, 393, 1284} form a rectangle, and therefore 63<SUP>2</SUP>+1284<SUP>2</SUP>=1224<SUP>2</SUP>+393<SUP>2</SUP>=1652625. I used to be very interested in finding large grids with this property - to this end I wrote some very complex programs to search for smaller grids and then "stitch them together" into larger grids. In the examples below, I have one 8 by 8 grid with 42 points on it (out of a total of 64), and one complete 6 by 4 grid with all 24 points - these were my master creations. I also found a complete grid which was 3 by 81, and I could have extended it even further, but the values were numbers hundreds of digits long.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Another recreational math interest of mine has been square-packing. Here are a few examples I did: <A HREF="sqrp1.pdf" tppabs="http://bork.hampshire.edu/~bernie/math/sqrp1.pdf">example1</A>, <A HREF="sqrp2.pdf" tppabs="http://bork.hampshire.edu/~bernie/math/sqrp2.pdf">example2</A>.
