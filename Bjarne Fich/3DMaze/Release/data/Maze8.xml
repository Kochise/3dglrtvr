# Build parameters:
<sizex>50</sizex>		# Defines the Depth of the maze

<wall_solid>0</wall_solid>	# Should walls be drawn solid by default (1=yes)
<wall_lines>0</wall_lines>	# Draw lines on walls (1=yes)

# Flags matches keys: s=solid, l=lines, t=textures
# When using textures, Solid don't work. Use a transperent texture!
# Solid don't look good without lines (Bounding errors)
