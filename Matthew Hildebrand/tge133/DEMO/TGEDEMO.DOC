Before running TGEDEMO for the first time, you should tell TGE where to
find its data files; in order to do so, simply type the two following
lines, assuming that you installed TGE in D:\TGE:

     set TGEDRIVERS=d:\tge\drivers\
     set TGEFONTS=d:\tge\fonts\

The trailing backslashes are necessary.  If you plan to use TGE in your
programs, you may wish to add these lines to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.


This demo program does not demonstrate all of TGE's features, but it does
give some idea of what TGE can do.
