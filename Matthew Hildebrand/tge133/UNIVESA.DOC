WHAT IS IT?
ßßßßßßßßßßß

The Universal VESA TSR, or UNIVESA, is Copyright (c) 1993 by Kendall
Bennett; it was not written by the author of TGE, but is included with the
TGE package as a courtesy to those without VESA BIOS drivers for their
SuperVGA cards.  It may also be of use to TGE software developers, who are
allowed to distribute UNIVESA with their programs free of charge, so long
as UNIVESA remains unmodified.

UNIVESA (not UNIVBE) is currently at version 4.2; however, version 3.2 is
included with the TGE package because newer versions are no longer freely
usable.  If you are interested in obtaining a newer version anyway, refer
to the WHERE TO GET THE LATEST VERSION section of this document.

UNIVESA is a small Terminate and Stay Resident (TSR) program which
implements the revision 1.2 VESA BIOS extensions.  By having a video card
which has a VESA compatible BIOS, or by installing this TSR, programs that
support the VESA programming interface will work correctly with your
SuperVGA.



HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS
ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß

UNIVESA contains '386 dependant code, so it will only run on machines that
have an 80386 or better CPU.  Currently UNIVESA supports the following
SuperVGA chipsets (note that not all of these have been fully tested):
    - ATI Technologies 18800, 28800
    - Ahead A & B
    - Chips & Technologies 82c451/452/453
    - Everex
    - Genoa Systems GVGA
    - OAK Technologies OTI-037C, OTI-067, OTI-077
    - Paradise PVGA1A, WD90C00/10/11/30/31
    - NCR 77C20/21/22E
    - Trident 88/8900
    - Video7 V7VGA versions 1-5
    - Tseng Labs ET3000, ET4000
    - AcuMos AVGA2
    - S3 86c911/924/801/805/928
    - Advance Logic AL2101 SuperVGA
    - MXIC 86010 SuperVGA
    - Primus 2000 SuperVGA
    - RealTek 3106 SuperVGA
    - Cirrus CL-GD 5422 SuperVGA
If TGE does not support your SuperVGA's chipset directly, or if its support
is buggy in some way, install UNIVESA and try again.

The Universal VESA TSR seems to have problems with QEMM, since QEMM does
something weird with the Video BIOS.  In order to fix this problem, you
should use the QEMM 'exclude' options to exclude the video BIOS area; do so
by including "EXCLUDE=C000-C1FF" in the QEMM options.



HOW DO I INSTALL IT?
ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß

You can install the TSR from the command line, or from your AUTOEXEC.BAT
file.  Don't worry about installing it twice; it will automatically detect
if you have already installed it.

To install UNIVESA simply type "univesa" from the command line.  It will
determine what type of SuperVGA card you have installed and install itself
accordingly.

You may also use command line options to override the the automatic video
card detection logic.  The following help message is produced by typing
'univesa -h' at the command line:

     Options are:
         -v       - Check for VESA BIOS first
         -s<name> - Force detection of SuperVGA 'name'
         -c<x>    - Force detection of SuperVGA chipset (numerical id)
         -m<size> - Force memory size to 'size'
         -d<x>    - Force DAC type (0:VGA, 1:15 bit, 1:16 bit, 3:24 bit)
         -i       - Do not perform SuperVGA detection

     It is possible the SuperVGA detection code will hang the machine on
     old VGA/SVGA cards. You can optionally force the program to work with
     any combination of card, chipset, memory size and DAC, but unless you
     specify the -i option, unspecified values will be filled in
     automatically for you.

Thus, if the detection code did not correctly identify your video card
configuration, you can force UNIVESA to work with the correct values.

When installed, UNIVESA takes up approximately 9 kb of memory.  All of the
code required to detect the video adapter and available video modes is
removed after the program is installed, saving on the amount of memory
required.  You may load the TSR high.



WHERE TO GET THE LATEST VERSION
ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß

You can probably download the latest shareware version of the package from
your local BBS, or you via the internet using ftp from Simtel20 or garbo
(and their mirrors).  However, the absolute latest version will always be
available from the following ftp site:

    godzilla.cgl.rmit.oz.au (131.170.14.2): kjb/MGL/univbe??.zip

The official support BBS for SciTech Software products is PC Connection
Australia.  This BBS has 12 9600 bps modems supporting MNP2-4 and MNP5 data
compression.  You can log on and download SciTech Software files for no
charge; however, if you wish to access the support forum, it costs $0.50 an
hour in connect charges (payable via credit card).  You can send mail to
SciTech software as a non-registered user by mailing the userid SciTech.
