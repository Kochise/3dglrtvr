This development log for the Earth Screen Saver begins on
August 11th, 2002 with the development of version 3.0 from
2.0a.  Prior development was almost entirely derivative of
Home Planet and merited only brief mention in the README.TXT.

Integrated "Scream Saver" library for easier testing.  This
involved the addition of files screamsv.c and screamsv.h, as
well as the addition of the Scream Saver menu, "SCREAMSV" to
the resource file.

Fixed anachronisms in code dating from 16-bit days.  For the
moment, I fixed only those which the compiler (Monkey C 5.0)
complained about (for example, _cdecl in the externals from
SCRNSAVE.LIB); others remain which do no harm and occasion no
natters.

Changed year format to display full four digit year number.

Replaced topographic map with NASA cloudless Earth image.  I built
a 2048×1024 image from the original 8192×4096 NASA image, reducing
the full colour image to a palette of 117 colours as required by
the rendering code.  Then, using Paint Shop Pro, I created a custom
palette with "subdued" versions of the shades in slots 0-116 and
the day side shades in 128-244.  This image was then imported into
the resource file as IDB_NASA_DS.

Made a 128×64 pixel thumbnail of the NASA cloudless Earth image
for the DLG_CREDITS dialogue, imported as IDB_NASA_NIGHT, and
updated DLG_CREDITS to use it, changing the text to cite the
NASA image instead of the NOAA topographic map used previously.

Fixed screen saver logic to be restartable for debugging under
Scream Saver (this isn't necessary when run as an actual system
screen saver).  This involved the usual chasing down of ratty
pre-initialised static variables which must be re-initialised
when the screen saver is restarted from the test jig.

Added an imageUp flag in Earth.c which is set when a new Earth
image has been painted and cleared when a new image is being
prepared.  The timer tick code which updates the date and time
now suppresses painting the update unless this flag is set,
which avoids a Microsoft-style "now you see it, now you don't"
flash of the date and time, immediately erased when the image
is painted.  Now the date and time will commence updating only
after the image appears.

Created a 2048×1024 night side image, also reduced to a palette
of 117 colours, and imported as IDB_NASA_NIGHT.  This will be used
to synthesise a day/night image when that mode is selected.

Changed the version to 3.0 in all the various places it lurks.

Added a check box to the configuration dialogue to control whether
city lights should be shown on the night side of the globe.  The
global BOOL controlling this is "nightLights".

Added logic to fill in night side pixels from the night image.
Rather than add lots of ugly and inefficient conditionals to
moveterm() in Viewfrom.c, I wrote a new moveterm_dayNight()
which is optimised for this case and simply have moveterm()
invoke it if nightLights is set.

Cleaned up a bunch more 16-bit anachronisms: NEAR, __huge,
_fmemcpy, etc.  These were previously fixed with definitions
in Sunclock.h--now they're fixed in the source code and the
definitions have been removed.

Posted to Visual Studio .NET.  I had to manually remove an include of
"ver.h" from the earthscr.rc file to get the resources to compile,
and add comctl32.lib and scrnsave.lib to the Linker/Inputs list as
they'd been lost in translation from Monkey C 5.0.  Some statements
in the Earthscr.def are now obsolete and generated warnings, so I
removed 'em.

Changed the version number in the configuration dialogue to 3.1, and updated
the VS_VERSION_INFO resource item accordingly.

Modified the Makesrc.bat script to include the Earthscr.sln and Earthscr.vcproj
files in the source archive instead of the .dsp and .dsw files from the
earlier version of Monkey C.

Added a note in Readme.txt to invite the user to check the original Web page
for the program to verify that they have the most recent release.

2006 July 21

Modified the settings load and store code in Scrnsave.c to use the registry
instead of a private section of the CONTROL.INI, which cannot be accessed on
machines where the user does not have administrator privilege.

Moved the weekday names in the string table to a named block called
idsWeekdays which starts at 5000.

Moved the formats in the string table to a block starting at
3000 named idsFormats.
