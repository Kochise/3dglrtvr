HOW TO COMPILE WITH LCC-WIN32 ?
===============================
The provided Makefile.win32 can be used with the lcc-win32 free compiler. This
compiler is downloadable from http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~lcc-win32

To compile, open a shell (msdos prompt), make sure that lcc's bin directory is
in your PATH environment variable, go in RollerCoasterScreenSaverSrc directory
and type make -f Makefile.win32, or you can rename Makefile.win32 to Makefile
and just call make.

If everything went well, the RollerCoaster2000.scr file must lie in the bin
directory. That's all folks.

HOW TO COMPILE WITH VISUAL C++ ?
================================
The provided Makefile.vc should work with the VC++ compiler. Actually, it has
only been tested with VC++ version 5.

To compile open a shell (msdos prompt), go to the RollerCoasterScreenSaverSrc
directory and type nmake -f Makefile.vc
It should work. But before doing that you probably have to execute a file
called "VCVARS32.BAT" and that lies in vc's bin directory. This file sets the
shell environment to be usable for compiling.
