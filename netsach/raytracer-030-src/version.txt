	- added computeColor to RayTracer
	- added LightRayTracer
	- moved Scene::ambientlight to LightRayTracer
	- updated SimplestRaytracer & LightRaytracer's toString
	- added & modified Object::convert* methods
	- corrected bug in Object::convertPoint3dToGlobal (local vector computation error)
	- corrected bug in Ellipsoid::getSurfaceData (normal vector computation error)
	- corrected bug in Intersections::getFirstVisible (using epsilon to skip start point)
	- added LogConsole member in Utils, and moved epsilon from Polynom
	- updated computation progress output

v0.2.1 - 22th july 2003

	- corrected bug in the Polynom::solve2 that had
	  some depth glitches for consequence

v0.2.0 - 21th july 2003

	- not using namespace 'std' anymore
	- classes renamed for lexical coherence
		'World'          -> 'Scene'
		'SolidRayTracer' -> 'SimplestRayTracer'
		'BasicRenderer'  -> 'SimplestRenderer'
	- added Row3d, Matrix3d, and Vector3d classes, with operators
	- added logging system ('Log' and 'LogConsole')
	- Utils class created
	- Printable interface rewrote for every class
	- Base3d is now always orthonormalized, rotation enabled
	- added ambientcolor and ambientrefractionindex, in 'Scene'
	- Polynom::getZeros returns a std::set of zeros, without multiplicity
	- Intersections now computes every intersection, through Object
	- added conversion to localbase for Ray/Object intersection
	- the algorithm is now 'objet-oriented' : through Intersections,
	  IntersectionData, and per-object intersection computing
	- corrected a bug concerning view size and orientation

v0.1.1 - 7th july 2003

	- corrected a bug concerning bitmaps (missing fill-bytes)
	- instanciate from string now returns dummy object instead of nothing
	- windows only, using visual C++ 6.0 from now on

v0.1.0 - 14th june 2003
