	<P><U><STRONG>Summary</STRONG></U></P>
	<P>
		swShader is a shader emulator using soft-wiring technology to get maximum 
		performance on a Pentium III compatible CPU.</P>
	<P><STRONG><U>Newest Version</U></STRONG></P>
	<P>This is a pre-alpha version.</P>
	<P>Please check <A href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sw-shader">http://sourceforge.net/projects/sw-shader</A>&nbsp;for 
		newer versions. You can also look in the CVS repository for the last version 
		tagged as stable or release.</P>
	<P><STRONG><U>Demo</U></STRONG></P>
	<P>The demo requires Windows 98/XP and a Pentium III compatible processor. Athlon 
		Thunderbird processors do not support the SSE instructions which are crucial 
		for good performance, and no 3DNow! version is available yet nor planned.</P>
	<P>Execute the application at your own risk. For more disclaimer information please 
		refer to License.txt.</P>
	<P><U><STRONG>Compilation</STRONG></U></P>
	<P>
		This library and demo was developed with Visual&nbsp;C++ .NET&nbsp;and has 
		project and workspace files for this compiler included. Should you have any 
		problems compiling the code with this compiler, please mail me at <A href="mailto:nicolas@capens.net">
			nicolas@capens.net</A>. Project files for other compilers might&nbsp;be 
		included but I can't give you support for them.</P>
	<P><STRONG><U>Interface Documentation</U></STRONG></P>
	<P>Because I strive for compatibility with DirectX shaders, the interface also 
		shows lots of similarities. With a good knowledge of DirectX and 3D graphics 
		theory, the use of swShader should be self-explanatory. For details please read 
		the demo source code.</P>
	<P><EM>More documentation will be added at an appropriate time. Please report problems 
			so I know what needs attention.</EM></P>
	<P><STRONG><U>Design &amp; Technology</U></STRONG></P>
	<P>Interpreters for&nbsp;shaders&nbsp;are horribly slow because of the thousands of 
		control statements and the redundant memory accesses. It is also often not 
		optimized with SIMD instructions which can boost performance by a factor of 
		about&nbsp;four. swShader solves both problems by&nbsp;compiling shader 
		instruction&nbsp;to optimized&nbsp;x86 instructions. The control statements can 
		be eliminated by compiling the shader for a specific render state, and storing 
		it in a cache.</P>
	<P>swShader is powered by a&nbsp;run-time assembler called SoftWire, also written 
		by&nbsp;Nicolas Capens. For the latest version of SoftWire please check <A href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/softwire">
			http://sourceforge.net/projects/softwire</A>. It features run-time 
		intrinsics, which allows to conveniently&nbsp;convert any shader instruction as 
		an x86 assembly block. It is possible to do register allocation and peephole 
		optimizations without multiple passes. In the future, automatic sheduling could 
		be added.</P>
	<P><EM>More documentation will be added at an appropriate time. Please report problems 
			so I know what needs attention.</EM></P>
