<h2>Trixel 3D Engine by Lode Vandevenne</h2>
<p> ************************************************* </p>
<p></p>
<h3>About</h3>
<p>Trixel is a real time volumetric raytrace engine in a voxel world. You can 
  move around in realtime at a low resolution, or render a detailed big image 
  at higher resolution.</p>
<p>This engine is a work in progress, so don't expect anything amazing!</p>
<p>The name Trixel is derived from Three Dimensional Pixel.</p>
<p>On an Athlon XP 1700+ it works great, but on machines less than 1GHz it runs 
  quite slow. This is not a fast engine, too bad, and I hope it'll be able to 
  run faster when more optimizations are added.</p>
<p>This version is version 2.02 and is released open source under the GNU General 
  Public Licence (see below).</p>
<p>The pixelplotting and input are done with SDL, http://www.libsdl.org/index.php</p>
<p>Some people requested me to release the source code so they could try to make 
  some improvements, someone wanted to add the technique &quot;Proximity Clouds&quot; 
  to it and someone else wanted to turn the cubes into smooth curves. I also hope 
  more people will be able to do something useful with it, improve it, or learn 
  something by looking at the source code.</p>
<p>Note: some people call this a raytracer, others call it a raycaster, so I guess 
  it's something in between.</p>
<p>Contact me at lode@vandevenne.net if you have any remarks, questions, problems 
  or suggestions. Please also contact me if you did something cool with it. Please 
  mention my name in your project if you used this code for it, parts of it, used 
  ideas from it or ported it, and leave other credits in the code intact.</p>
<h3>Detailed About</h3>
<p>Trixel is a Real Time Volumetric Raytracing engine, so it differs from most 
  raytracing demos as well as from the typical Wolfenstein 3D kind of raycaster. 
  Maybe it's best to compare with Wolfenstein 3D, but then instead of a 2D map, 
  the map is 3D. Volumetric Raytracers are sometimes used to display effects such 
  as fog or smoke, but Trixel features a solid world. The world exists out of 
  a X*Y*Z array of voxels (or 3-dimensional pixels, hence the name Trixel). I've 
  tested array sizes up to 256*256*256 but normally anything that fits in the 
  memory of the computer should work. Each voxel can be &quot;on&quot; or &quot;off&quot;, 
  if it's off rays go through it, if it's on, it looks like a solid cube. You 
  can give each voxel it's own RGB color and add a special effect, so in total, 
  one voxel occupies 4 bytes. In this voxel world, the camera is placed, rays 
  get shot from it, and using a modified 3-Dimensional Digital Differential Analyzer 
  (3DDDA) the first cube intersected by the ray gets detected. The nice thing 
  about this algorithm is that, unlike normal 3D engines or even normal raytracers, 
  the more cubes there are or the more complex the geometry is, the faster the 
  engine gets because the rays will hit a cube sooner. Normally, in a 64*64*64 
  world it works quite realtime on an Athlon XP 1700+ in a resolution of 320*240 
  pixels at 32-bit color.</p>
<p> Apart from that, the engine also supports quite a few possibilities for the 
  camera, including (in real time) rotating, moving and skewing the camera, and 
  looking/moving around with the mouse &amp; keyboard in 6 degrees of freedom.</p>
<p> The source code is written in C++ and compiled for Windows, using the free 
  Devc++ 4 compiler, and the source code is provided with Devc++ 4's project file. 
  To place the pixels and handle the input, SDL is used. It's probably very easy 
  to port the project to another OS than Windows.</p>
<p> This project is very small and pretty basic, not many special features are 
  added, but it should be easy to add almost anything. I've already succesfully 
  added lighting and texturing to it, and a 3D Game Of Life version, but these 
  features are not (yet) implemented in the &quot;clean&quot; Open Source code 
  I provide here.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Installing the binaries for Windows</h3>
<p>Unzip the files, put SDL.dll and trixel.exe in the same folder and run the 
  exe.</p>
<p>You can also put SDL.dll in your windows system or system32 folder, then it 
  can be accessed by any program.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Installing the source code </h3>
<p>The source code is written in c++ and is provided with a *.dev file for DevC++ 
  4, but it shouldn't be hard to use the code with any other c++ compiler that 
  you can get to work with SDL. All cpp and h files provided in the &quot;Src&quot; 
  directory should be put into one project.</p>
