If you want to improve the code here are some ideas:

-Make the pixel plotting faster
-Make raycasting algorithm faster
-Port to other platform
-Add proximity cloud algorithm
-Add some sort of interpolation or filtering to get rounded cubes and smooth shapes
-Add texturing (I've succesfully made a version with texturing already, it's not too hard)
-Add lighting
-Add colored lighting and multiple lights
-Add transparent cubes
-Add mirroring cubes
-Add refraction of light through transparent cubes
-Add support to save and load worlds
-Add windows interface to it with menus to change resolution, save/load world, ...
-Make a game with it, I already made a 3D game of life with it once :)

The screenshots that are in this folder:
screen?.png files are from the current version (2.02) and show how the camera can rotate and skew
the dev?.png files are just for fun, some of them weird images I got while developing Trixel, and there's also one that shows working texturing.
