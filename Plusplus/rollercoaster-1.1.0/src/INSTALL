HOW TO COMPILE UNDER LINUX ?
============================
Check the Makefile and if necessary modify it according to your system
configuration.

Then make it by typing make.

To execute the animation, make sure that the current directory is the one
containing the executable file and type ./roller

It should be easy to compile under other unix systems. The provided
Makefile.irix has been used to build RollerCoaster2000 on an Onyx machine.

HOW TO COMPILE UNDER WINDOWS ?
==============================
The provided Makefile.win32 can be used with the lcc-win32 free compiler. This
compiler is downloadable from http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~lcc-win32

You can download GLUT for win32 from http://www.xmission.com/~nate/glut.html
However you can't use the glut32.lib file that come with GLUT dll and header,
because it wasn't produced with lcc-win32.

Although lcc-win32 has its own glut32.lib, you have to modify it before you can
compile. To do so open the file glut32.exp that lies in lcc's buildlib
directory with a text editor. Add the following lines at the beginning of this
file, after the line containing GLUT32.DLL:

____glutGetFCB@4
____glutSetFCB@8
___glutCreateMenuWithExit@8
___glutCreateWindowWithExit@8
___glutInitWithExit@12

After that, open a shell (msdos prompt), make sure that lcc's bin directory is
in your PATH environment variable, go in lcc's buildlib directory and type:
buildlib glut32.exp
This commands generates a file called glut32.lib. Move this file in lcc's
library directory.

Now you are ready to compile by typing make. You can type make -f Makefile.win32
or you can rename Makefile.win32 to Makefile and just call make.

Alternatively, the provided Makefile.vc can be used to compile with Visual
Studio.
