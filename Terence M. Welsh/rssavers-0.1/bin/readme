Dependencies:

Skyrocket requires OpenAL for sound, and it will not function without
the OpenAL runtime installed.  If you do not already have the
OpenAL runtime installed, you can install it by running OpenALwEAX.exe.
The version of OpenAL32.dll that was distributed with previous versions
of Skyrocket is extremely old and will not work with the most current
version of Skyrocket.



Installing:

Extract the files from this .zip file using your favorite zip 
program (you should have already gotten that far or you wouldn't be 
reading this).

Place the .scr file(s) in the directory containing all your other 
.scr files.  This directory varies between versions of Windows, but 
it's probably something like "Windows\System32\"  

3.  Open your "Display Properties" window by right-clicking on your 
desktop background.  Click on the "Screen Saver" tab and select your
new screensaver.
