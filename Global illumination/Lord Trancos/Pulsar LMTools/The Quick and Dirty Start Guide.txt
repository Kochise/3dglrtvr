Pulsar LMTools Quick and Dirty Guide                        2003/02/12
----------------------------------------------------------------------

+ Introduction
  --------------------------------------------------------------------

  Ok. So you have checked the sample map and want to see what can
  LMTools do with your maps ?

  Well,... to use correctly LMTools, you have to read all the docs,
  (yes, those ones written with my poor english ^_^) and try to
  understand how all this works until getting nice results.

  To make things easier, this quick guide WILL TRY to help you to
  test LMTools with your 3D Maps, in the easiest and fastest way.

  But if this guide fails to do this, do not discourage; read the
  other docs.

+ What do you need ?
  --------------------------------------------------------------------

  Next ones are the things that you need in order to test LMTools in
  the easiest way.

  Remember that this is only ONE WAY to use LMTools, and all these
  things are not needed to use LMTools, but all is easier with
  them...

  + Your 3D Map in Autodesk 3D Studio .3DS file format.

  + If your 3D tool isn't able to export lights inside a 3DS file
    you will need Discreet's GMAX 1.1 or better (or 3DStudio Max if
    you can pay it);

      http://www.discreet.com
      http://www.discreet.com/products/gmax/

    [ As the web page says: "gmax is a free 3D modeling and animation
      tool based on Discreet's award-winning 3ds max (TM)." ]


+ Ready ? Have what you need ?
  --------------------------------------------------------------------  

  * If your 3D editor isn't able to export lights inside a 3DS file;

      > Run GMAX and import your map (the .3DS file).

      > Place some lights. Use only "Free Direct", "Omni" and "Target
        Spot" lights. NOTE: "Free Direct" will be aplied to all your
        map; use only as sunlight/moonlight.

      > Now use the SCRGen maxscript (see SCRGen.ms or Apendix B of
        LMGen.txt for details) in order to create a .SCR file.

      > Then use A3DS2LMTS to convert the 3DS file to .LMTS file
        format.

  * If your 3D editor is able to export lights inside a 3DS file;

      > Use  A3DS2LMTS to convert the 3DS file to .LMTS file format
        with the -scr parameter in order to export also the lights
        to a .SCR file. Example; a3ds2lmts map -scr     

  * You should have:

     - Your map in .LMTS file format. (map.1.lmts)
     - A .SCR file with info about the lights. (map.scr)

  * Open a command line (aka MS-DOS) window and type:

      CD "C:\Path_To_LmTools\BIN\"
      LMTools base_name

    Where base_name must be the name of the LMTS file without
    the ".1.lmts" part. Example; lmtools map

  * If all worked correctly (no errors); run LMDx and load the
    ".3.lmts" file. You must see your map with the
    generated lightmaps,... otherwise something is wrong... :(

+ Too many or too few lightmaps ?
  --------------------------------------------------------------------  

  That's because the default value for LIGHTMAP.LUMEL_SIZE isn't
  ok for your 3D Map.

  Read Apendix A from LMGen.txt
