5. RENDERING FEATURES AND OTHER STUFF

 *  Current Features of the GENS II 3-D Engine:

 -  Win32 and DirectX 7.0 based
 -  3D Studio MAX ASCII file (.ASE) format support (with limitations to some primitives)
 -  AFFINE TEXTURE MAPPING (visually much improved over Gens)
 -  FILTERED MIPMAPPING (visually much improved over Gens)
 -  Z-BUFFERING (16 BIT) - the per-pixel rendering has floating point Z-buffer
 -  Real-Time dynamic lighting and Ray-Traced shadowing (per-pixel and per-vertex)
 -  Significant overall improvement to the entire lighting system over Gens
 -  Basic Physics engine (collision detection, gravity and jumping)
 -  Basic Space Partitioning engine (sphere zones)
 -  Moving objects (can only rotate for now)
