Fluid Studios Public Release Policy                           December 22, 2000

                                                           www.FluidStudios.com
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fluid Studios will be periodically releasing non-critical portions of its
technology. These releases will come in various shapes and sizes. They may
be in the form of source code, or technical papers, or both.

Our policy is quite simple. We will release whatever we deem useful and fit for
public release.  We will not release any critical portions of the Fluid Studios
technology (this includes all proprietary technology which makes Fluid Studios
unique among its competitors.)

All releases are free of charge and may be used freely for commercial and
non-commercial use. We do require that credit is given, and that modified
versions of the source code or technical papers are not distributed without
clear documentation on how to obtain the original. All software and
documentation is released as-is with no warrantee (implied or otherwise.)

Note that some of the documents released here are pre-existing documents that
were written by the founder of Fluid Studios, Paul Nettle. These documents are
not being released, but merely re-distributed by Fluid Studios.
